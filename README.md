# News Analyzer: ML Based News Classification System
This project utilizes Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze news articles. It performs two primary tasks:

1.  **Fake News Detection:** Employs a Logistic Regression model to classify news articles as either real or fake.
2.  **News Summarization:** Generates concise summaries of news articles using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit).

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** A leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. Specifically, it leverages:
    * `nltk.tokenize`: For breaking down text into sentences (`sent_tokenize`) and words (`word_tokenize`).
    * `nltk.probability`: To calculate word frequencies (`FreqDist`).
    * `nltk.corpus.stopwords`: A list of common words to be filtered out.
* **Scikit-learn (sklearn):** A machine learning library in Python, used here for the Logistic Regression model.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis, likely used for handling the news article datasets.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd news_analyzer
    ```

2.  **Install the required Python libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install nltk scikit-learn pandas
    ```

3.  **Download necessary NLTK data:**
    Run a Python interpreter and execute the following commands:
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    ```

## Fake News Detection

### Model

The fake news detection component utilizes a **Logistic Regression** model. Logistic Regression is a statistical model that, in its basic binary form, uses a logistic function to model the probability of a binary outcome. In this context, the outcomes are "real" or "fake" news.

### Features

The model likely uses various textual features extracted from the news articles to make predictions. These features could include:

* **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF):** Measures the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.
* **N-grams:** Sequences of n words used to capture contextual information.
* **Word Embeddings:** Dense vector representations of words that capture semantic relationships.
* **Stylistic Features:** Characteristics of writing style that might differ between real and fake news (e.g., sentence length, punctuation usage, vocabulary richness).

### Usage

1.  Ensure you have a dataset of labeled news articles (real and fake).
2.  Preprocess the text data (e.g., cleaning, tokenization, stemming/lemmatization).
3.  Extract relevant features from the text data.
4.  Train the Logistic Regression model on the labeled data.
5.  Use the trained model to predict the authenticity of new, unseen news articles.

   *(Specific code examples for training and prediction would be included here if available in the project.)*

## News Summarization

The news summarization component leverages NLTK to generate concise summaries of news articles. The process typically involves the following steps:

1.  **Tokenization:** Breaking down the input text into sentences and then into individual words.
2.  **Stop Word Removal:** Filtering out common words (e.g., "the," "a," "is") that don't carry significant meaning.
3.  **Punctuation Removal:** Eliminating punctuation marks.
4.  **Frequency Distribution:** Calculating the frequency of each remaining word.
5.  **Sentence Scoring:** Assigning scores to sentences based on the frequency of the important words they contain.
6.  **Summary Generation:** Selecting the top-scoring sentences to form the summary.
